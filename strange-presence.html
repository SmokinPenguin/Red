    <h1>Strange "presence" that would visit me in the middle of the night and creature clawed my window - u/Kiddo1621</h1>
    <p>This was about a year ago.<br><br>
I had recently experienced several traumas and was all alone through it all. I would stay up all night because my mind wouldn't let me rest. This was the worst time of my entire life. So I had depression and insomnia.
<br><br>It started out innocent. Every night a "presence" (that's what I'll be referring to it as) would "visit" me and stay for about an hour. Everything in my house would become still. There was a distinct heaviness in the air. It felt like there were eyes watching me from every window and everywhere I went. It was very strange but not malevolent. Just observing me. Curious even.
<br><br>About 3 weeks after this happened I noticed the presence came at 3 am or a bit earlier. Every single night.
<br><br>After about 2 months of this visiting presence, it became malevolent. Like it hated me. That heaviness in the air became crushing. Like it was trying to squeeze out my very breath. It started to scare me.
The first night of it being evil and hating, weird shit happened. It sounded like drums were banging. Except I couldn't pinpoint where it was coming from. It was like it was coming from every direction and completely surrounding my house. Then it got cold. Real cold. In my house it was like 53 degrees. I didn't touch the thermostat. This cold and drums went on until the crack of dawn.
<br><br>After 6 months of the malevolent observing me, (about 8 months total of observing me) something very strange happened. You need a little bit of context to understand. In my room my bed is parallel to the wall with the door. There is a window right in the middle of my bed. And the wall next to that has a window too. We have cats who at the time were kittens. They would jump up on the window sills and bird watch. They destroyed my blinds on the window by my bed so they could bird watch. Only the bottom few blinds were gone. This made me very uneasy.
<br><br>At around midnight one night I heard a long scratch on the window not by my bed. I turned around and nothing was there. No kittens, nothing that could have made that noise, and nothing outside. This should have put me at ease but it put me on edge.
<br><br>The next night around the same time there was another scratch. Except it was about 10 inches away from me. It was at the window by my bed. Now remember how I said the kittens destroyed the lower blinds on that window by my bed? This allowed me to see what was scratching my window. All I saw was a hand. If you can call it that. There were 3 long fingers with a long claw attatched to each finger. The skin was pale. It contrasted notably with the pitch blackness of the night. This scared the shit out of me! But I stayed calm. The encounter only lasted for about 6 seconds.
<br><br>I thought I was crazy. So the next morning I went outside to my window. The claw marks were there. They pierced the glass! I knew I wasn't crazy. To this day I have no clue what to think about any of the events that took place at that damned house. I'm glad I moved. Does anyone have any thoughts? Sorry this was so long.
