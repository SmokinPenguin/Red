    <h1>Haunting Experience at Ohio School - u/CMarg1738</h1>
    <p>So I’ve wanted to share my experience at a school in Ohio forever, but never found a place online to do so. This subreddit seems like the perfect place!
My mother worked at a public elementary school back around 2013. For a bit of back story, the school had been rebuilt three times from the 1800s on due to fires and updating, but had been in its current form since around 1920 I believe. My mom worked in this building for about three years, and it was shut down about five years ago and repurposed.
My mom often was one of the last few in the building at night, and she told me about how the building just felt off to her. One weekend afternoon she was working in her office and heard what sounded like someone making a racket and slamming things around on the curtained stage. She was the only one in the building. I believed her of course, and I seem to be gifted with some kind of perception for these sort of things due to other experiences.
One Saturday she asked if I would go with her to pick up a file she’d left at work. She told me she was too scared to go by herself after her experience with the noise on the stage about a year before. We parked in the back of the building and our car was the only one there. It was a sunny day, but the building was still very dark. We went in through the cafeteria entrance, which connected to the gym/cafeteria/stage space on the ground floor. The room was super dark, with only a bit of ambient light coming in. Light enough to see without the overhead lights on, but still dim and very eerie. We had to cross the gym to get to her office, which was a basement level office with no windows (a glorified janitors closet really lol). We were fine walking across and got the file she needed. That’s when it got weird.
When we exited her office and reentered the gym, it was as if the energy in the building completely shifted. I’ve never felt such hateful, negative energy in my life. I got that gut sinking feeling you get when you know you’re being watched. I instinctively knew if we looked up in any direction we’d see something we didn’t want to see. I’ve never felt so scared in my life.
Without saying a word, my mom and I grabbed each other’s hands and sprinted out of the building. Only when we were locked in the car did we speak, and my mon told me she felt the exact same way I did. We both felt such a negative presence in the building. I can’t even begin to describe how awful it felt. I wish I could pinpoint for you all exactly what was in that building, but the only word that comes to mind is pure evil. Maybe it was a vengeful spirit. Personally I feel it had to be demonic with the dark energy it brought to that school.
One of the office workers from the school became a close friend, and we shared our experiences with her. She confirmed that something had been off with the building for as long as she worked there. Even the janitors told my mother that they had experiences too.
Here are a few of the stories I’ve heard:<br><br>
•	One of the janitors heard a huge crash at night on the second floor. He went up to look around and found student desks had been shoved and flipped over. Again, he was the only one in the building.<br><br>
•	A teacher stopped by at night with her husband to pick up some forgotten paperwork. The husband watched lights flick on in the building while he waited in the car. She got back in the car, and he said he saw all the lights she turned on. Her room was on the opposite side of the building. She hadn’t turned on those lights.<br><br>
•	Lots of employees heard footsteps from above. The school had two floors of classrooms, a ground floor with the offices and classrooms, and the gym floor as mentioned. It didn’t matter where you were in the building - you could hear footsteps above or behind you if you were alone.<br><br>
•	The school was located in a rougher neighborhood, so they had a motion/sound sensor camera security system. The system was tripped one night and recorded. Upon review the next day, the area where the system was tripped had no movement seen on camera despite being detected, and the sound recorder just screeched. When submitted to the local police not even they could figure it out - and admitted they had no logical explanation. It shouldn’t have malfunction the way it did, and when tested it worked fine. <br><br>
I wish I could describe the eeriness and negativity this building had for all of you better, but I hope my account brings a fraction of the spookiness I witnessed to life for you!
