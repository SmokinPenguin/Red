    <h1>I have never experienced genuine terror until last night. - u/girldannydevito</h1>
    <p>I want to start off by saying I have NEVER experienced anything visual like this before, if there is a possible explanation I would like to hear it.
My girlfriend and I are in the process of moving into a basement suite, we still technically reside at our old place across town for another 3 days. Her name is the only one on the lease since we’ve been having some relationship issues due to work stress and personal problems.
This basement suite we moved into had been completely gutted and most of the appliances and flooring replaced, except for the bathroom. It’s now a ‘city legal’ suite with its own water heater etc since there had been a “massive police investigation” done a few months prior. We weren’t told much about what happened here other than “drug related incidents.” I went into the bathroom to do some cleaning yesterday evening and noticed what looks like blood at the bottom of the radiator. I’ve attached a photo at the bottom of the post
It seemed creepy and I didn’t want to touch it just yet because gross. Anyways, a few hours pass and my girlfriend goes to bed in the bedroom and I fall asleep on the couch watching tv. I woke up around 4am to our cat knocking a plant off the window sill and fucking with the blinds. (The lights were off but I have a big black light aquarium in the living room which lit up most of the living room/kitchen area.)
My girlfriend came out of the room to ask what was going on and I was all pissed off, half asleep cleaning dirt off the counter tops. She told me to leave it for tomorrow and to just come to bed and then walked away. I stayed up and continued cleaning for maybe 20 mins since there was dirt all over the place.
This is what fucking terrifies me even thinking about it now-
I was in the kitchen wiping down the counters, (it was pretty dim but I could still see, it’s now around 4:30am) I turned around towards the garbage can and my ‘girlfriend’ is standing in the dark doorway just staring at me. I couldn’t see her face clearly but it was a 6ft thin figure, the exact build as my girlfriend. I said “sorry if I’m keeping you up, I’m almost done.” She just stood there facing me. I figured she was just pissed off since we had been arguing off and on this whole week. I finished what I was doing and walked past her and asked if she was coming to bed, she didn’t move. I walked straight into the bedroom and closed the door and my girlfriend was laying there sleeping. I woke her up by closing the door and I guess the look on my face scared her enough to make her spring up in bed, wide awake and ask what happened repeatedly. I started gagging, swearing and pretty much just lost it for a minute or two. I told her I just saw her in the kitchen and she said “well yeah, I came out earlier and asked what happened.” I told her no, I JUST walked past her into the bedroom. She pretty much just went silent, peeked out of the door and nothing was there. We both went to sleep a while later. I don’t get strange feelings here at all which is the weird part, but holy fuck. I have no idea what that was last night and it scared me so bad I almost threw up when I realized my girlfriend had been sleeping that past half an hour. I have no idea what to make of that.
TLDR; my girlfriend and I just moved into a new place that has a pretty confidential/criminal history. I found what looks like dried blood on the floor in the bathroom and I saw what looked exactly like my girlfriend standing in the door way when she was really fast asleep in bed.
home info update for those who are interested
I just spent an hour trying to find out more about this new place my girlfriend and I are living in and it was pretty difficult. I found the old realty listing of the basement suite and both “property history” and “public facts” were blank which is odd considering most major police investigations/drug busts/condemnations are made public, especially in our small city. Nothing came up on our news site either but after just googling the address, about 9 search results down on the Canadian yellow pages site there was a guys first name (initials MDG) with his name, number and our address. I searched his name in our cities obituary site and sure enough he was dead and only 28yo. He died just a couple of years ago, I’m not sure if he was the last to live down here or not but somebody did die in this place not too long ago.</p>
