    <h1>I am still processing this... - u/ForgetfulNerd</h1>
    <p>I drive for Uber and I stopped at this house a few hours ago. As I'm waiting, a light turned on upstairs and this little boy was turning the lights on, waiving at me, then turning them off. He did it a few times and was smiling and looked like he may be laughing. I waved back and smiled and even though it was late, I didn't even question it. The girl got in my car a few minutes later. I thought she took so long because the kid was hers and I commented how cute the kid upstairs was and her face went pale. She looked me straight in the eye and told me no one lives upstairs. I laughed because it's spoopy season and I thought she was messing with me. I stopped shortly after I looking in the rearview mirror and saw that she was...starting to cry. She took a few deep breaths and asked me what I saw. So, I told her about the little boy turning on the lights. She called her boyfriend who was still there and was full on freaking out. Turns out her boyfriend had several people mention the kid that plays with the lights and waves!
I would have thought it was a joke, but she was shaking and almost had a panic attack about this. Her boyfriend was woken up by the call and the entire downstairs was dark when I picked her up. I have no other explanation for this because of her reaction. My hair is still standing on end thinking about it.
Edit: Thanks for the award! I honestly didn't think this story would be received so well!
Oh my goodness! Thank you all so much for the awards! I'm blown away.
For those worried about the child and suspect foul play, I did place a call to the local police and they did confirm that there is no child at the residence, although they wouldn't tell me if the upstairs apartment was occupied or vacant. I am driving again tonight so I will try to stop by on a break and see if it happens again. If it does, I will have my camcorder to try and capture anything out of the ordinary. I could not hear anything but he did seem like a little kid that was having fun and being goofy rather than being in any distress. I have been around enough kids to tell the difference as I used to work in a daycare. Thanks again for your enthusiasm! This isn't my first encounter like this and am trying to capture more and more! I hope to share more in the future.
UPDATE So I went back to the house. I sat there for a bit and nothing happened. With the moon being so bright (it was really cloudy yesterday) I could sort of see into the window where I saw him. The lady wasn't kidding, there is nothing up there. No photos or furniture that could be seen. The apps on the second floor but it is has those long windows that almost reach the floor. Anyway, there was no movement inside. However, as I started to drive away I saw a kid in the yard running...but there was no noise to it...no crunching leaves or anything. I had my window open, radio off, I would be able to hear footfalls or at the very least the shuffling of leaves. It was just a glimpse and I waited for something else but there was nothing. I think it is safe to say that there is something on that property. I have to look into the history of the property. It is a really rough part of the city and many many people die in that area yearly, but I am still curious that turns up.
