    <h1>Two men and a bus stop - u/marhigha</h1>
    <p>When I was 18 I was working two jobs, both at diners. One was in a downtown area in a Colorado town and the other right next to the highway. This night I was working at the one next to the high way. Both diners were in fairly quiet towns that after 9 pm were practically empty as people were home. It was summer time so I was walking to the bus stop at about 10 pm and the bus stop was only about two blocks away from the diner.
I get to the bus stop (a park and ride) and it is lit but everything around it is dark. I had walked the five minutes in darkness more scared of bears than the thought of people when I really should’ve been more scared of people. I sit down on the bench and know my bus will be there in about 15-20 minutes so I’m reading but keeping an eye on my surroundings. Two men walk up to the stop and sit two benches down from me.
<br><br>They start talking, loudly, about how pretty I am and how I shouldn’t be alone. They’re homeless and typically in this town people are calm and almost everyone knows everyone so I just ignored it knowing the bus would be there soon. But then they start talking about how I owe them something for being so pretty and one says “If you don’t look at us I’ll drag you to the bushes bitch.” They started to move to the bench next to me so I called my parents house and ask for my dad. My brother tells me to shut up and just ride the bus because I can’t explain what’s happening in front of the men as I know that’d lead to them immediately attacking me. He hung up and I called my dad, and at this point decided to walk away from the bus stop, booked it across the road and ran away from that stop. The men tried to follow but with me being on the phone and talking to someone they stopped. I told my dad what was happening and he called the police and met me at a store down the road.
<br><br>I was young and dumb and didn’t make a report (my dad did) because I didn’t get a good look at the men and felt guilty for some reason. I should’ve made a report because those men ended up raping two other women at that bus stop over the next few nights. My incident was included in their sentencing and they were sentenced to prison, I don’t remember for how long but they got justice. My dad picked me up from work everyday after that despite me stupidly saying I was still gonna ride the bus. I will always thank God I had the sense to call someone and not just try to run. Always be on the phone or pretend to be if you feel unsafe because most of the time it will help you get out of there safely.
<br><br>Edit: my brother was not a bad guy in this situation, and he would have reacted different if he knew. Older brothers can be asses but he is an amazing guy and loves me a lot. Just wanted to throw this in so nobody thinks ill of him. Also, thank you for the awards, ya’ll are very kind!
