    <h1>Apparently I scared my family as a kid. - u/Kiezec96</h1>
    <p>I remember looking through a photo album with my mom awhile back and we came across some pictures of my aunt's house which happened to be farm. I actually have a memory of that place even though I was only 4 at the time, particularly of this little girl I used to play with there.
It was so strange because it was my first memory of meeting my aunt and uncle as well as my cousin, they were all in eachothers arms, except for this little girl who had long curly blonde hair, fair skin, blue eyes, wearing this blue overall dress with a white shirt underneath and she was just standing there off to the side of them, ignored by everyone else and yet she was looking at me with a charming smile. I remember being really confused about this and wondering if she did something really bad to be ignored like that.
Sometime later on we were having dinner and at some point I remember seeing her again at the stairwell, beckoning me to come play with her. So I asked mom if I could go play and she said yes. Everyone was so engrossed in eachothers company that they didn't even notice me heading up the stairs with her and into my aunt's bedroom where the girl led me to a closet away from all the chaos.
The closet door was left just a crack open, allowing some of the light from the hallway in, illuminating her face. She hands me some cards and of course I had no idea what to do with them, so she attempted to teach me. This went on for sometime until my mom started calling out my name, searching for me. Just as my mom enters the room the little girl starts to evaporate into the shadows, escaping my vision and I was suddenly left alone in the closet with a hand full of cards.
So when I seen those pictures in the photo album I asked my mom what had ever happened to that house. My mom tells me that auntie sold it, and when I asked why she said that it was actually because I freaked them out. Intrigued by this I pressed on a little more, asking what exactly had happened.
She said that when they noticed I wasn't around they went looking for me, eventually finding me in my aunt's room in her closet playing with some cards. No one knew where I got those cards from, and they were especially weirded out when I wouldn't stop asking where the girl (who's name I can't recall) was.
I did end up telling my mom about that experience and she took interest in it, but you could tell she was also becoming unnerved by it and we eventually ended up changing the subject.
It's so weird though having that memory. I honestly thought I had another cousin when I was little and I thought my aunt and uncle were hiding her from me. That was until my auntie gave birth to a little girl and I evtually just moved on from trying to see that girl again.</p>
