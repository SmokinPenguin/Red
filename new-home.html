    <h1>Bought a new house, but I feel strange about the basement. Looking for advice. â€“ u/GasStationSandwich-</h1>
    <p>I'm married with 3 kids. The kids are older: 20, 17 and 10. We just bought a house and moved in first week of December.
Our room and my 2 daughters rooms are upstairs and my 20 year old son has a room in the basement. There's a storage room across from his room, then a big area with a fireplace where I have my gaming console, TV and chair set up.
Anyhow, on Christmas day, the wife and kids are getting ready to go to her dad's house. I'm not going because me and her dad don't get along.
I fire up the PlayStation in the basement and put on my headset. They're all upstairs running around cause they're going to be late, and I see my son come downstairs and head into his room to grab something.
A few minutes go by and I'm focusing on my game. Out of the corner of my eye, I see what I thought was my son leave his room and walk into the storage room, then slam the door hard and loud enough I hear it through my noise cancelling headset.
I pull off my headset and yell: "What the hell, man !?" and look over at the storage room.
The house is quiet. I walk over and open the storage room door. It's a 10x10 room with no windows and nothing in it.
I look in his room, he's not in there. I go upstairs and they've already left. The van is gone. I told my wife about it and she just laughed.
Funny thing is, I never mentioned it to my son, but the other day, I came home from work and he says: "Damn Dad, I could here you in the gaming room until like 4am. I'm surprised you made it to work this morning." Me and all the girls were in bed by 9pm that night.
