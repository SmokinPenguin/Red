    <h1>This sub made me realize I might have experienced something that I, until now, have tried to dismiss as sleep paralysis. - u/Valrossfetma</h1>
    <p>This happened about five years ago and I was living in a different city while going to university. This was in Sweden so I’m sorry for any errors in this text. Firstly, I’m prone to lucid dreaming and therefore just convinced myself that this was a dream, even though it didn’t feel like it. I lived in a small apartment on the fifth floor with a pretty big balcony with glass windows that you could slide open all around. I am very sensitive to light when I sleep so I usually had the blinds shut both out on the balcony and on the windows that were on the wall “between” my bedroom and the balcony. <br><br>One night I woke up because of a blue-ish light shining in through the blinds, at first I thought it was the moon but it felt too bright. I looked towards the balcony to see if I missed closing the blinds out there, which I admittedly had, but I realized it wasn’t the moonlight I saw out there. It was much smaller and much closer. It hovered over another apartment complex a couple of hundred meters away. I instantly felt a primal fear I have never felt before, my heart just dropped in my chest and I had trouble breathing. I couldn’t look away and I couldn’t move. Some rational part of me had a quick thought of “is this sleep paralysis?” but then I felt eyes on me, many eyes, and I just knew I had to try to hide. I hid under my blanket and closed my eyes hard. I kept thinking “I didn’t see anything, I promise, I didn’t see anything” over and over again. I had such an adrenaline rush that I was shaking. The next thing I know it was morning again and my body was ACHING. I was in pain but it felt like the pain came from the inside. Like when you get lightly shocked from an electrical fence, it hurts really bad for a second, then it’s just an overall feeling of ache and tingling. I could still remember everything up until I closed my eyes and hid under the blanket. The ache and the tingles disappeared after a couple of hours.</p>
