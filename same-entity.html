    <h1>My Family has Been Followed by the Same Entity Since 2006 - u/Special_Drive_871</h1>
    <p>In 2006 my mom went on an overnight business trip and brought something back with her. My parents were in the middle of a divorce which meant it was the perfect time for something to attach itself and feed off of our negative energies. The morning she got back from the trip she was telling us about all the creepy things that happened in her hotel room. She had just told us that the tv kept turning on when all of a sudden our stereo turned on at full blast. We all sat there in shock looking at each other before my brother got up to turn it off. We immediately stopped talking about it and went about our day. For the next four years we would all experience odd happenings but they were always small enough that we could write them off as something else. That was until 2010 when my mom moved into a new home that had just been built.
Right off the bat we all noticed how dark the house was, it could be a sunny summer day and the inside of the house would look dark and bleak. The ghostly happenings in that house initially started with my brother. His room was situated in the front of the house just next to the formal living room, which we used as a computer room. He would tell my mom and sister that he would wake up in the early hours of the morning to the sound of someone typing on the computer. When he would get up to check, the monitor would be on but there would be no one at the computer. One night in particular he woke up to the sound of typing, went out to investigate and saw the monitor was on again but this time the chair was spinning in a slow circle as if someone had gotten up and walked away in a hurry. When he told my mom the next morning, she assured him that it must have been a dream and to just ignore it if he’s woken up by it again. He listened to her advice and the computer stopped turning on in the middle of the night for a while. But, it started up again a couple months later and this time it was accompanied by something else... this was when my brother saw a full body apparition. He told me years later that he saw, what he thought was me, standing in his doorway one night. He said he opened his eyes, saw me standing there and told me to go back to sleep. When he opened his eyes again, he saw me crouching down by his bedside at eye level, staring at him. He quickly sat up in bed, rubbed the sleep out of his eyes, looked around the room, and saw that he was completely alone. He got up, walked over to my room and saw me fast asleep in my own bed. That night, he left the house and never stayed past 8 o’clock again.
Once the entity had driven my brother away, it targeted my sister. She recalls experiencing similar things, she’d see my brother or me crouching at her bedside or in her doorway and she’d hear cabinets in the kitchen opening and closing. She woke up one morning to a package of oreos sitting open on the counter with all the cookies smashed to bits and pieces(she had been home alone that night so there was no explanation as to who did it). None of this scared her though and she didn’t experience anything besides those few occurrences. This is when I started to experience strange things. At the time I was 10 years old and I had no idea what had been happening to my brother and sister in our house (they didn’t want to scare me).
For me, it started by seeing shadow people in the hallway multiple times a day and the kitchen cabinets would always be open even if no one had been in the kitchen all day. Then one night I saw it. It was a normal school night and I was lying in my mom’s bed reading a book. Her bedroom had its own bathroom attached with two sinks with two huge round mirrors facing the doorway that connected the two rooms, with her bed facing the door. As I was reading my book I got the sudden urge to look up and into the mirror on the right side of her bathroom. What I saw haunts me to this day. At first glance I thought it was my brother so I looked away, that’s when I remembered that my brother had left a half hour ago. My eyes shot back up to the mirror and I got a good look at what was looking back at me in the reflection of the mirror. It was tall and had a big mess of hair plopped on the top of its head. It’s skin was grey and it’s face had no features. It had no nose, in place of its eyes it had two gaping black holes. It had no lips, in place of those was a black hole as well. I sat there staring at it for a couple seconds and even though it had no eyes I knew that it was staring right back. I screamed and threw the blankets over my head, pleading for my mom in my fit of terror. She came running in, pulled the blankets off of me and asked me what happened. I was shaking as I told her what I saw and I remember seeing fear grow in her eyes as she looked over her shoulder into the bathroom. To ease my mind she told me that it was common for mirrors to play tricks on people’s eyes and that I was probably imagining it because of the book I was reading. We moved out a few months after that incident and I haven’t experienced anything like that since I lived there. To this day I have no idea who or what was tormenting us for the year we lived there and maybe I’ll never know.
