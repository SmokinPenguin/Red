    <h1>I briefly lived in a 300 year old farm house that was famous for being a key property in the underground railroad in Indiana. Here's the quick version of what we experienced while there! Feel free to ask me anything! - u/low_hanging_nuts</h1>
    <p>Here's what I remember
<br>1. My mother collected glass angels. One night we woke up to her freaking out because every single angel in the house (probably close to 100 angels) was turned 180 degrees around and faced away from the center of the room. She would normally only have them face the center of the room.
<br>2. My sister and I both saw the same extremely tall, thin man in a baggy coat walking around in the hallways at night. We didn't even know we both saw him until almost a decade later when we were talking about it.
<br>3. My aunt came over once and was stirring her coffee with a spoon when the spoon stopped on its own and started stirring in the opposite direction.
<br>4. My dad had set his coffee down on the table one day and when he walked back in the room the coffee was, as he described, "aggressively" stiring itself. Like the metal spoon was upright in the air and everything. This one still bothers him to this day.
<br>5. The house wouldn't ever get cold, but it WOULD get extremely extremely hot all of a sudden before returning to normal temperatures - specifically upstairs in my sister's room.
<br>6. There was a hidden room behind a bookshelf and under a fake floor where slaves crossing into Indiana would hide. This is the only writing on the house I remember reading - and I specifically remembered seeing claw marks on the walls of that room (to be fair...it was an old house. Who knows what kind of critters have been down there).
<br>7. Things would get knocked off shelves and furniture would move almost constantly. We had a center coffee table with pull-out stools and the stools would be found all over the place, even on top of tables.
<br>8. The top floor of the house burnt down in the 70's. No one was injured or died in the fire, but they did have to rebuild the upstairs. On the stairway up to the second floor there was a distinct portion of the wall where the house was obviously rebuilt (it went from brick to drywall right at that spot).
<br>9. Oh fuck nearly forgot this one. This was a big one. When we were looking at the house before moving in, before we even walked in, my sister said "Did someone die here?" Turns out someone did die after falling off of a ladder and cracking their head on the little walkway up to the front door. I remember my mom thinking it was super weird once she found out what had happened.
<br>And really that's it. I don't distinctly remember hearing voices, seeing shadow creatures lookin' for beans, or anything outside of these exact events. I've just been thinking about it a lot recently and figured I'd type it up.</p>
