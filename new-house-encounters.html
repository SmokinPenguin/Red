    <h1>New house ghost encounters - u/musicalstitch</h1>
    <p>I want to start this say I was a sceptic till about a month ago and now I don't know what to do so I would like some advice or more knowledge on what is happening. So it all started when I met some friends in a house share. Nothing happened there and the three of us (I'll call one of my housemates A and one K) we decided to rent a house and moved in there on 07/12/20. For ease, I'm going to bullet point our experiences that have happened in this short time. We have debunked some of our experiences but some we are left scratching our heads and these are the points we would like some clarification;<br><br>
14/12/20: Housemate A heard footsteps upstairs multiple times whilst nobody was in or downstairs. Sounded like footsteps were being dragged along floor. Eventually both Housemate K and I heard it when we was in the kitchen and no one else was in.<br><br>
30/12/20: About 2-3AM, across multiple mornings while in my bedroom which is next to the living room on ground floor, I hear the living room doors creaking, even though they both have door stops so cant move at all.<br><br>
04/01/21: Housemate K has a nightmare about a dark figure entering the house and during night, has multiple nightmares with the figure making its way further into the house. Nightmares end with figure standing outside bedroom door.<br><br>
05/01/21: Housemate K starts noticing door wide open when returning home when they know it was closed before leaving.<br><br>
14/01/21: Housemates K & I hear something or someone moving something in Housemate A's room. As we investigate, all noise stops and nothing is there<br><br>
20/01/21: Still hearing footsteps, bangs and rustling every now and then in Housemates A & K’s rooms. Sometimes within other locations in the house.<br><br>
28/01/21: Without knowing any of the experiences mentioned above, a guest mentions they feel a creepy sensation in the hallway leading to Housemate K's room.<br><br>
28/01/21: That same night, Housemate A and guest heard a door open upstairs whilst everyone was downstairs. Housemates A & I Investigate to find Housemate 1’s bedroom door open.<br><br>
30/01/21: On multiple occasions, Housemates A & K perceive strange perfume and musky smells within the living room on or around midnight.<br><br>
03/02/21: At midnight arriving home from work, Housemate K see’s shadow of man approximately 6" in the window of my room from about 1 meter away despite the fact I'm asleep. They thought it was me and when they checked again a couple mins later it was still there. That same night I dreamt of a shadow of man in utility room. At 5am, Housemate A sees shadow on stairs through front door window moving towards the utility. Believing the shadow is trying to tell us to look for something there, Housemates investigate utility area and within it's loft, find what looks like old clothes and bedding but there is no way for anyone to get in. Everything is always locked and no evidence of a person.<br><br>
04/02/21: Housemate K See’s shadow of man, clear as day like he was outside bedroom window of Housemate A, on second floor looking in.<br><br>
05/02/21: Housemate K heard slow turning/rattling of upstairs bathroom door handle whist in bedroom.<br><br>
06/02/21-Housemate K and A felt as if they were being watched in their own rooms in the morning before going to work. On the evening, Housemate A experienced an odd electrical issue with beard trimmer just going from 50% battery, to 0% instantly and couple seconds later the door swung open.<br><br>
12/02/21: early hours of morning after work Housemate K finds bathroom light on and bedroom door open. I also heard two sets of footsteps running back and forth in upstairs bedroom as I wake up at 3am to go to the toilet. My room is located under Housemate K's bedroom.<br><br>
13/02/21 Musk smelt again by Housemate A & K and it lingered for nearly a minute.<br><br>
Side notes:<br><br>
- Atmosphere often changes at the drop of a hat then disappears again within seconds.<br><br>
- Motion sensor Light outside Housemate A’s bedroom goes off early hours of morning when nothing there at all. Can't remember the date it started but happens every couple days.<br><br>
Hot spots in house that feel unsafe:<br><br>
- Living room: Behind the sofa near the back wall.<br><br>
- Hallway outside of Housemates K bedroom and hallway leading to it.<br><br>
- Conservatory<br><br>
None of us have dealt with paranormal experiences and occurrences are becoming more bold and obvious. We are looking for any knowledge or help to get rid of or deal with whatever is happening in our house, if anyone can help it would be appreciated.
