    <h1>Alien Abduction Phenomenon in Virginia - u/ITwasA_one_timething</h1>
    <p>This story is true and takes place in 2012 within Stafford county Virginia. I was 22 years old at the time.<br><br>
Late one night I received a call from my friend T asking me to hang out. It was 10:30-PM. It wasn't unusual to start our night this late. We barely slept most nights anyway. It was a fairly uneventful but fun night. After some bud-light platinums and a few hours of video games, I was tired and ready to go home. I lived within 2 miles of T and felt totally comfortable driving home. I said goodbye and left his place at 2:15-AM.<br><br>
I made my way home enjoying the winding and bending of the roads. Stafford county contains many back country roads with hairpin curves. The roads were completely empty at this time.
As I made my way around a curve, I slammed on the brakes and came to a screeching halt. This is when things would start to become very strange.
<br><br>About fifteen to twenty feet out in front of me are deer. A LARGE number of Deer. I never counted but there were easily 30 to 40 of them! I had never seen so many Deer in one place. I was amazed. Some were lying down on the road with their front and back legs tucked under themselves. Where as others were just standing around. All were blocking the road. I tried honking my horn. Nothing. Not a single movement from the deer. Then that's when I noticed something that really disturbed me.
<br><br>The Deer were staring at me. Not only that, but I hadn't seen a single one move a muscle. Not even a twitch or a single blink. I felt the blood rush to my face as I realized something just wasn't right here. It was deeply unsettling. I tried yelling out the window at them. Nothing. I tried more honking and even turned music up as loud as it would possibly go. Still nothing. Just a blank, still, and black eyed stare.
I began to get very impatient about this whole thing. I figured deer were scared of people. I'll get out and walk toward them. They will eventually get up and run. I will admit, I was starting to get scared but I couldn't reason with the feeling. Why am I scared? It's only deer I remember thinking. But I knew something just wasn't quite right. This wasn't normal at all and I knew it.
<br><br>I get out of my car anyway and leave the door ajar. But before I could do anything a wave of dizziness and nausea hit me incredibly hard out of no where. I held on to the side of the car for balance. I remembered thinking maybe it's the alcohol? But there was no way. I only had 3 beers or so in a time period of about 4 hours. I continued to lean against the car with my body facing away from the deer and began to vomit. I threw up maybe 3 or 4 good times. I threw up until there was nothing left. I noticed the vomit had a strong metallic taste/smell. Gross.
After a few deep breaths the intense nausea and dizziness started to subside. I regained my composure and turned back around.
<br><br>The deer were GONE... But, I never heard or saw anything move. I quickly looked around. I looked toward the road, the trees, then back to my car. Nothing. Absolutely nothing. Everything was silent and dark.
I got back into my car and started the engine. I drove quietly with no music all the way back home. My thoughts were racing and I didn't feel right. I couldn't put my finger on it but I just didn't feel right at all.
When I got home I pulled straight into the driveway. The house was dark and everyone was still asleep. When I got out of my car I lit a cigarette before going back into the house and reached for my phone to browse the news or Facebook out of boredom. My phone was turned off. I never turn off my phone.
<br><br>When my phone loaded back up, more questions arose.
My weather application had weather updates based off a location from somewhere in Maine? I wasn't in Maine. I've never even been to Maine. That's when I saw something that made my blood run cold. The time read 4:40-AM. A 2 minute car ride was somehow over 2 hours long!
<br><br>To this day I have no clue what happened. The loss of time with the events that transpired make completely no sense. Every search on the internet leads me back to alien abduction. I guess I will never truly know what happened to me here.
