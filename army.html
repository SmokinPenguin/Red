    <h1>I’m in the Army - This is what I’ve experienced on military bases - u/jamielynne96</h1>
    <p>FORT SILL: I was there for basic training. Every night we took turns doing “fire guard”. It’s basically where two soldiers rotate every hour to watch the door and make sure everyone stays in bed. There were four barracks bays. Ours, the female bay, was upstairs and across the hall from a male bay but we used separate stairwells. So us females and drill sergeants were the only ones using this center stairwell.
The drill sergeants would come up to check on us periodically. The doors were heavy and loud. We could clearly hear when they went into the bay across the hall. So every now and then we would hear footsteps come all the way up the stairs and stop. Neither of the doors would open and we’d never hear them go back down. We even heard objects ROLLING DOWN THE STAIRS. You could hear them hitting every individual step as they went down. It was so scary.
After lights out, everyone had to stay in bed. We had to let the fire guard know if we were getting up to go to the bathroom and no showering was allowed after that time. There were times we would hear people talking in the bathroom in the middle of the night and sometimes hear the showers going. So we would go look because we all would get in trouble if anyone was up making noise... but no one was in there. I should also mention, the lights are motion sensed. So we would walk in and the lights would turn on. Meaning a physical person hadn’t been walking in there for at least a few minutes.
Our beds were in rows all lined up. One night we all got woken up by a scream right next to our row of beds. All of us sat up at the same time, freaking out and looking at each other. We couldn’t figure out where it came from.
<br><br>FORT PICKETT: This was 2019 during our annual summer training. We were in the field, which is basically like camping in tents. There was a large open field were the medical tent was, and then our personal tents were back in the tree-line. There were a few nights where people were woken up by something shaking their tents, whispering their names, or vivid nightmares. Some even saw figures standing outside their tents. Some people had dreams where they woke up only to be in another dream. I was with another sergeant in a two person tent far off to the edge of the group. One night, I heard footsteps all around our tent, almost circling it. As if a whole platoon was walking past us... slowly. But our medical area was so far away from all of the other training areas and as far as I knew, no one was out training at 2 am that day.
(Not paranormal, but the entire place was INFESTED with spiders. When we first got there, we went into the woods to set up our sleeping tents, within five minutes there were six spiders crawling on my pant legs. Definitely not my favorite annual training.)
<br><br>FORT INDIANTOWN GAP: My ex used to tell me, while he was sleeping, that he saw a man or figures standing next to the bed or in the corners of the room. He often saw a man with a mustache. I don’t know who it could have been but anyway... Fast forward to another annual training, we had some free time one day and most of us decided to go back and take naps in the barracks. The girl in the bunk next to me was asleep for about an hour when she woke up and asked me if she had been screaming. I said no... you didn’t say anything the whole time, you were just sleeping. She said she just had sleep paralysis and thought she was awake. In her “awake dream”, she was in the same barracks with all of us, but we were all staring at her. But the thing that got me... she said there was a man with a mustache standing next to my bunk. He was bent over and was the only person looking at me instead of her. She’s a complete skeptic and I had never told her about what my ex saw too.</p>
