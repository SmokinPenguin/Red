    <h1>Something my daughter told me terrifies me... - u/Mixtus</h1>
    <p>This past year my family went on a sabbatical in another country. My daughter (4) talks a lot about returning to our old house and something she said recently gave me chills.
Daughter: “When we go back, can I sleep in Mommy’s room”
Me: (no backbone) “Yes, sometimes we can have sleepovers. But don’t you remember, you have a huge bed to sleep in in your room. All your toys are in there.... your stuffed animals....”
Daughter: “But that guy, remember, I wake up at night because he’s there with me.”
Me: (mentally freaking out) “What? No I don’t remember. What man?”
Daughter: “He sits in the corner. He’s all black, he doesn’t talk he just sits by me.”
Me: “what, what does his face look like?”
Daughter: “He has no eyes, but I think he has a mouth.”
Me: (in shock) “Well..... you can definitely sleep in my room....”
What the fuck is that. Also how is she so nonchalant about some terrifying thing in her room like this.</p>
