    <h1>I Lived in a Haunted House for 6 years...My Terrifying Story - u/ParanormalNexus</h1>
    <p>It has taken me a long time to come to terms with what happened in my house in Knoxville, Tennessee and am finally ready to share. To give a little background, my family (mom, dad, older brother, and I) moved to Tennessee in 1995 from Mexico. We moved to a very old ranch style home in Knox county and did not realize that this home would be the site of some of the most harrowing and terrifying experiences I have ever experienced. I am convinced that many occurrences have been suppressed in my mind but I want to share with you the memories I do remember. My hand is shaking as I type this out, as these experiences haunt me to this day and are not easy to talk about.
The activity in the house first began with the usual paranormal stuff you hear about: missing items, misplaced/moved belongings, strange creaks/noises around the house (nothing that can’t logically be explained). It wasn’t until we decided to add a room to the home about 4-5 months in that shit really began to hit the fan. I began to experience unusual things a few times a week to almost every single night thereafter. To give some perspective as to the layout of the home, upon entering, the living room is the first thing you see. To the left is a small hallway leading to my parent’s bedroom. To the right of the living room is a very long and narrow hallway that leads to a guestroom then the room my brother and I shared for a short while. The hall ends with a bathroom and the entryway to the kitchen and extra room directly across from my brother and I’s room. Essentially, my room was on the complete opposite end of the house from my parent’s room.
Anyways, now that the picture is set, I will describe several of my experiences. While my brother slept in the room, I would experience nightly terrors in which I would see someone standing at my doorway. It would never move but the only way to describe it was a tall shadowy figure with noticeably long white string-like hair. It would watch me several times a week and I would feel so terrified that all I would be able to do is cover my head with my blanket and pray it would go away. I told my parents what I had seen after the first night but they merely chalked it up as me having had a nightmare (typical). Eventually, it got to a point where I began to sleep on my side with a blanket over my head with a small opening for me to look through. This continued for 2 years until my brother got his own room. That is when things really took a turn for the worst. I remember sleeping at night and seeing the same shadowy figure standing at my doorway. Feeling just as terrified as the previous times seeing it, I did the usual go to and covered my face with my blanket hoping upon uncovering myself, it would be gone. This time was very different. Upon uncovering my face, the same figure was standing in the room merely feet from my bed. I panicked and covered my head again wondering if I was going mad. Upon uncovering my head once again, I saw that it had gone and with a sigh of relief I turned onto my back. This was not a good move. Upon turning onto my back, I saw the same figure was now floating over my bed on the ceiling. (I was on the top bunk so you can imagine how close it is now). The only way I can accurately describe this humanoid-like entity is that it looked like a mix of a grey alien and a very tall crypt keeper (from that one show). The second I saw it, I covered my face once again and felt absolutely petrified with fear. I then felt the figure lay on top of me as I lay frozen on my back. I remember hearing it breathing, sounding like a quiet almost asthmatic wheeze and how cold its breath felt. I remember the distinct earthy smell emanating from its mouth as it breathed inches from my face, the only barrier being my blanket. It felt like hours passed frozen in terror feeling completely helpless. This occurrence was something that began to happen almost every night and only happened to me. (Maybe because I was the youngest?) Throughout my time living in that house things progressively got worse. I would be lying in my bed reading a book with all the lights on when I would begin to hear scratching under my bed. I would peek under and be overcome with the same paralysis I would feel at night and the feeling of the figure lying on top of me. I would feel it pull me off my bed and onto the floor in the middle of my room and stare into my soul as I kept my eyes closed in sheer terror. My mom would later recount several times in which she would walk into my room and see me lying in the middle of the room on my back. She would ask me what I’m doing to which I would essentially snap out of it and tell her I was fine, too scared to talk about what had happened. I remember if I slept on my chest, I would feel like a force would pick me up (2-3 ft) by my shirt and drop me back onto my bed. This happened so often that to this day I am reluctant to sleep on my chest, not because I’m afraid I’ll be picked up (now a 220lb adult man, good luck) but because something in my subconscious mind tells me that it is not a good position to be in. My parents would tell me that I just had nightmares all the time but they did not realize this nightmare was something I experienced every night. Years later, having endured this every night, I began to see an additional apparition in the home. I began to see a young boy in the long stretch of narrow hallway that my bedroom was situated in. I would see him peeking out of different rooms at me while I was in the hallway only to disappear out of sight into rooms only to see he had disappeared upon my investigation. That would be the extent of my interaction with him but I would see him often and only during the day time. The apparition did not appear to be malicious unlike the other figure that tormented me at night. He gave me the impression that he was merely an observer, which was comforting, in a way, that this ghost did not want to mess with me unlike that crypt keeper entity.
Over a decade later, now living in Atlanta, I decided to look up the address on google maps to show a friend and noticed that the home was now the site of a home business. Upon seeing that I decided that I would reach out to them out of curiosity and see if they had had any similar experiences. The business would later reply saying that they had never had more electronic issues in the home than anywhere they had ever been and that strange things occurred frequently. He told me that his wife and kids complained about seeing a little boy wandering around the hallway and were scared to live in the home. The man also described seeing a tall shadow occasionally when he was working in his office (which actually turned out to be my old bedroom.) He told me he always felt like he was being watched and felt generally uneasy in that room in particular. What is peculiar about this is that I had not described any of my experiences prior to him telling me his, yet our stories appeared to line up. I showed my parents the message thread I had with this business and it was then that they confirmed that they believed the house was haunted. They didn’t want to say anything that would scare me even more and tried to bury it under the guise that I was having nightmares. My mother said that she would see the same little boy wandering around the kitchen and hallway and she always felt that feeling of being watched when no one was home but her. Neither of them had seen the tall figure and it seemed it was focused on me.
The experiences I had in that home are permanently burned into my mind and I will never forget that tall wire-haired figure that constantly picked me up, laid on me, and pulled me around, terrifying me to the core. I do not plan on ever returning to that home and I pray no one who has the misfortune of living there experiences what I did on a nightly basis for six fucking years. I’ve always been curious about deep hypnosis and what it may reveal to me but I am equally terrified to remember events that my own mind deemed too traumatic to keep in my conscious mind. Thanks for reading.</p>
