    <h1>Does anyone else remember a family member no one else does? â€“ u/invisibleunclejojo</h1>
    <p>I apologize for the throwaway, I don't want my friends to think I'm crazy.
I have a twin brother, and we both remember a guy we called Uncle JoJo. He was an old guy, I can picture him so clearly in my mind. And when my brother and I describe him to each other he looks exactly the same. One thing we both remember is that he was missing his right index finger and half of his middle finger.
We both have really vivid memories of him taking us out to the lake and buying us various food. He taught us how to make a tire swing, which is still by the lake. We both remember putting it up with him.
We've noticed that no one has any idea who he is. Not our parents, not our older siblings. They remember absolutely nothing. They told us we used to escape a lot; all the doors would be locked and we'd both somehow of escaped and they could never find us until we came wandering back hours later. They called the police several times, and we'd knock on the door just as they got through, even if they'd just been looking down the street and we weren't there.
My brother and I have no idea what could of happened. All of this happened between the ages of four and eight, and then we never saw him again. When we look back at pictures, days out where we were sure he was there, he's not in any of them. It feels like he's supposed to be there. Sometimes there's a weird gap, right around where my brother and I are standing.
Has anyone else experienced this? Our parents seems to thing he was just some make believe friend.
(I originally posted to glitch in the matrix bit someone suggested I post here - sorry for the copy and paste, I'm really tired and couldn't be bothered to write up a whole new post)</p>
