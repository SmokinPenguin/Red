    <h1>My dog barked a week after she died - u/ernestomarord</h1>
    <p>Moxie was 14 years old. She was a pit mix. Sweet dog with lots of personality. On New Year's Eve 2020, she suffered a: <br><br>
<span id="vestibular">Vestibular disease</span> which refers to a sudden, non-progressive disturbance of balance. It is more common in older dogs. It is also referred to as old dog vestibular syndrome and canine idiopathic vestibular syndrome. <br><br>
This happened while I was walking her and the other dog, Kuma, together. We were about half a block from the house when this happened.
After the diagnosis on the 1st and Jan 6th, her health deteriorated. Lost about 20 lbs. and refused to relieve herself outside, even with a comfortable sling I had gotten for her to ease her walking, and to ease my back.<br><br>
She died on February 1st, around 9AM. Sadness all around.<br><br>
A week later, on the 8th, we were in the kitchen making dinner when suddenly, her indistinguishable bark of happiness was heard down the hallway, from our bedroom. One loud bark (this is something she would do on a regular basis to get our attention, so we could help her get on the bed). We both stopped what we were doing and stared at each other. The other dog looked down the hallway also.<br><br>
I said: that was Moxie!<br>
Her: it was!<br>
Me: She must be saying hello from the afterlife.<br><br>
We both (and Kuma) curiously went to the bedroom, turned on the light, and there was nothing out of the ordinary... just the notion that she barked at us from the afterlife.
